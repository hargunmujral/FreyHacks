## Project Description 📝:

- helps find ideal times for activities that depend on weather         conditions   
- especially water sports
- 

As the weather gets warmer and more activties become accessible, it becomes increasingly difficult to chose what to do in your past time. Our team has developed an app that can solve that problem. our carefully formulated software is capable of processing local weather data and reccommending weather dependant activities based on current and future weather conditions.

## Inspiration💡:
- We are lonely and want to find friends who do fun things

## What it does 📱:
- helps people plan and attend activities
- feature to find and add friends
- feature to find public events
- suggests activities and events based on conditions (weather, location, time, etc.)

## How we built it 💻:

## Challenges we ran into 💥:
- nested queries in graphql didn't work
- sql alchemy is refusing to have multiple subsequent queries
- most of us had never written in the language our whole job was in

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🍀🍾:
- getting the weather api to work
- solving nested queries issue
- completely custom cidc piplines through github actions digitalocean ssh

## What we learned 🧠👍:
- Learned how to access and integrate data from an api

## What's next for Activity 🥚🐣🐥:
- Adding more activities
- Adding more paramaters to validity
- Improving UI

## Frontend
- React Native with TypeScript

## Backend
- GraphQL API in python with flask

## Hardware 
- Probably nothing is gonna happen here
